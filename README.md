## 📊 Project Objectives

- Analyze weekly payroll job indexes from ABS (2020–2021)
- Compare trends across key Australian industries:
  - Accommodation & Food Services
  - Retail Trade
  - Health Care & Social Assistance
  - Mining
  - Other Services
- Visualize COVID-19’s impact on workforce size and recovery

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Significant job losses were observed in **hospitality and retail** sectors during lockdowns.
- **Health care and mining** showed stronger resilience.
- Recovery patterns varied sharply between industries post-lockdown.

**Deep Dive: Pre- vs During-COVID Impact by Industry**
To quantify the economic shock, we compared the average payroll jobs index **before** and **during** COVID-19 for selected industries:

| Industry Division                     | Pre-COVID Avg | COVID Avg | % Change   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Accommodation & Food Services         | 98.59         | 94.35     | **-4.30%** |
| Rental, Hiring & Real Estate Services | 99.28         | 96.79     | -2.51%     |
| Transport, Postal & Warehousing       | 99.63         | 97.17     | -2.46%     |
| Education & Training                  | 99.79         | 97.37     | -2.42%     |
| Wholesale Trade                       | 99.85         | 97.96     | -1.89%     |

🧠 Interpretation
- **Accommodation & Food Services** faced the sharpest decline (~4.3%), reflecting vulnerability to lockdowns.
- Other industries experienced moderate declines between **~1.9% to 2.5%**.
- No sector in this subset fully returned to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2021.

> 📅 **Periods Used**:  
> - Pre-COVID: `2020-03-07` to `2020-04-04`  
> - COVID Impact: `2020-04-05` to `2021-06-26`
